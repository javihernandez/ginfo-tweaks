About ginfo-tweaks
------------------
Ginfo-tweaks is a fork of ginfotweaks (http://launchpad.net/ginfotweaks).
Ginfo-tweaks is a personal initiative as a telecentre solution application.

Ginfo-tweaks is a panel launcher that provides an easy user interface for 
running custom scripts from a centralized application in a telecentre
environment. Mostly focused on making the life better for the distribution
maintainers, the technical support team and of course, the users on the 
telecentres.

Launchers and categories are described in the Freedesktop's "Desktop Entry 
Specification" standard, and custom icons for lanchers and categories are 
supported. Launchers can be runned with priveleges or without them, so users
can create their own launchers and share them with other people.
